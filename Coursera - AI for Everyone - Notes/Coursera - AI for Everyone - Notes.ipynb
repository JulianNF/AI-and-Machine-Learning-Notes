    "## AI Comes in Two General Flavours\n",
    "- ANI -> Artificial Narrow Intelligence\n",
    "\t- Very good at one specific task\n",
    "\t\t- Translation\n",
    "\t\t- Image recognition\n",
    "\t\t- Self-driving car\n",
    "- AGI -> Artificial General Intelligence\n",
    "\t- Good at doing anything you ask of it (smart like a human, if you will)\n",
    "\t- The holy grail, but we’re not there yet\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between ML and AI is frequently misunderstood. ML learns and predicts based on passive observations, whereas AI implies an agent interacting with the environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning\n",
    "- A form of ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)\n",
    "- Typically are large systems that run 24/7 and can be constantly queried in order to get specific outputs.\n",
    "- When computers have the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while **machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, **machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples**. As such, **generalization in the context of ML is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also an overlap between ML and data mining, in that both often employ the same methods and overlap significantly. However, while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input A results in output B\n",
    "\n",
    "![examples of supervised learning](img/aiForEveryone-supervised_examples.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "Machine learning is becoming a reality because we’re starting to have lots of training data available to us. This “big data” allows us to provide lots of input data for the network to be trained well enough to be quite accurate in 99% of cases it is used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "![data vs model performance](img/aiForEveryone-data_vs_performance.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "We also have strong computing power (GPU) necessary for crunching this data mathematically in order to train our AI models and also to get outputs from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "Machine learning can help us crunch the complex relationships between multiple inputs (e.g. room size, room count, total floorspace, etc) in order to derive an accurate expected sale price.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to acquire not only lots of data, but also accurate data. If we’re trying to make an ANI that can detect cats, we need to find a collection of hundreds of photos with cats and label these correctly as containing a cat. Typically, this kind of training data will be manually labelled by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use data collected from daily operations such as sales data (e.g. price, basket size, day of week, time on website, etc.) in order to increase odds of sales and sale size. Another example is with machine data (e.g. pressures, hrs since last breakdown, temperatures, time of day, etc.), where the data can help us determine the likelihood of a machine downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Misuse\n",
    "Don’t wait 3yrs to first collect data before starting to build your model. Instead, start feeding data to your AI time as soon as possible. This way, they can start putting together the AI model and see which data is missing in order to get strong results (e.g. temp data ever minute instead of every 10 minutes making a very big difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data is Messy\n",
    "garbage in = garbage out\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data (i.e. tables of data) can still be difficult to work with because of:\n",
    "-\tIncorrect data entries\n",
    "-\tMissing values\n",
    "-\tIncorrect labels\n",
    "There’s also the challenge of unstructured data (images, audio, text) which can be harder to use in order to create an AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference Machine Learning vs Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "![machine learning vs data science](img/aiForEveryone-ml_vs_data_science.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a data science project is typically a series of insights that can help make business decisions, rather than a specific output to a given input. It also involves human observation of data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the boundaries between data science and machine learning are somewhat fuzzy, as they can both benefit from each other, and they often get spoken about in similar circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Learning\n",
    "(Artificial) Neural Network comprised of (artificial) neurons that compute data in order to be able to process the probability that multiple inputs represent output X.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term “neural network” has started being replaced by the term “deep learning”. (probably because the optics are more friendly...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks don’t actually work like a biological brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different terminology overlaps in certain way, perhaps something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![venn diagram of ai vs ml vs deep learning](img/aiForEveryone-ai_ml_dl_ds_venn_diagram.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "## What makes a company AI-first?\n",
    "- Using the powers of AI as much as possible -- strategic data acquisition in order to boost business AND model improvement\n",
    "- Setting up and maintaining a unified data warehouse so that models can use alllll the data available\n",
    "-  A focus on automating everything that can be automated\n",
    "\t- Faster\n",
    "\t- Better data collection\n",
    "- Creating new roles (e.g. MLE) and roles in order to make sure that AI/ML has the attention it needs to be an actual priority\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps towards an AI-first company\n",
    "1.\tExecute pilot projects to gain momentum\n",
    "2.\tBuild an inhouse AI team\n",
    "3.\tProvide broad AI training\n",
    "4.\tDevelop an AI strategy\n",
    "5.\tDevelop internal and external communications to help all stakeholders understand how you’re working\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Machine Learning _Can_ and _Cannot_ do\n",
    "It’s important to do technical diligence (2, 3 weeks) before agreeing to carry out an AI project\n",
    "- Look at the data, its size and quality, its complexity, etc.\n",
    "- Look at what kinds of outputs are desired, and whether those might be achievable with the data set\n",
    "\t- The simpler the concept that the ML needs to “grasp”, the more likely it is to succeed\n",
    "\n",
    "👍A general rule of thumb: **Anything that a human brain can do within ~1 second, we can probably now (or soon) automate using machine learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- ✅ Check for scratch or damage in manufactured phone\n",
    "- ✅ Check text to see if the customer request is for a refund or return\n",
    "- ✅ Identify what is in front of a car based on a photo and some radar data\n",
    "- ❌ Use photo of person far in front of car to determine if they’re asking car to stop, are a hitchhiker, or a cyclist signaling that they’re turning left, etc.\n",
    "\t- Hard to find a good enough dataset to determine the intent of the person\n",
    "\t- Due to the risk involved, the ML output MUST be extremely accurate, making the task even more difficult\n",
    "- ❌ Use data to provide a 50 page go-to-market strategy\n",
    "- ❌ Create an AI that can write a 2-3 paragraph sympathetic email in response to a customer complaint (especially if only using a small training data set), and get subtlety and nuance right every time\n",
    "- ✅ Given 1000s of x-rays with diagnoses, from different sources, identify if a lung x-ray presents pneumonia\n",
    "\t- ⚠️Even using data from one medical center might make the AI model weak, as maybe x-rays from another clinic might be at a slight angle, scratched, more/less focused, etc. causing the model to completely fail\n",
    "- ❌ Given only 10 photos of lungs with pneumonia from medical textbooks, identify if a lung x-ray presents pneumonia\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demystifying Deep-Learning\n",
    "### Determining product demand\n",
    "The simplest artificial network, with one neuron. This neuron computes the slope of the curve based on the input data, and when queried, outputs a predicted demand for a given price X:\n",
    "\n",
    "![simple neural net](img/aiForEveryone-simple_neural_net.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "A slightly more complex artificial neural network will take multiple inputs and have more neurons accordingly. These neurons reflect a sort of probabilistic relationship between all the input data, and any data derived from connecting said input data into new data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![more complex neural net](img/aiForEveryone-more_complex_neural_net.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, typical neural networks used today are much larger, with thousands, tens of thousands or even more, neurons.\n",
    "The neural network figures out the connections between the different inputs (and the output of those intersections) and what matters the most. We don’t do this for the neural network. Remember, as Arthur Samuel (1959) said, machine learning is about **“… computers [with] the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does a Neural Network do Face Recognition?\n",
    "Let’s say that the neural network’s job is to take in lots of pixel data and identify the name of the person in the image.\n",
    "Remember that each image is a bunch of pixels, each with a different RGB value (if color), or brightness (if b&w). If the image is 1000x1000 pixels, the neural network will take in 1M values as input (B&W), or 3M values as input (RGB)\n",
    "The neurons in the network will typically achieve different results:\n",
    "- “earlier neurons” -> identify borders in the image\n",
    "- “middle neurons” -> detect parts of objects \n",
    "- “later neurons” -> detect parts of face\n",
    "Again, remember that the neural network figures out which neurons it needs on its own.\n",

    "## How to choose an AI project\n",
    "Sometimes it takes a while for a worthy AI-project idea to emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everything that could be valuable for your business/project will be feasible using AI. It’s best to put together a cross-functional team of AI experts and domain experts in order to come up with good AI project ideas.\n",

    "### Brainstorming framework\n",
    "- Think about automating specific tasks rather than automating jobs. This helps get actionable and valuable AI project ideas right away.\n",
    "- What are the main drivers of business value?\n",
    "- What are the main pain points in your business?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: you can make progress even without big data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having more data almost never hurts, but big-data is often overhyped\n",
    "- If your problem is very clear and specific, you may not need so much data\n",
    "\t- E.g.: even 10/100/1000 photos of defective mugs from your factory may very well be sufficient to get a useful ML algorithm deployed at your production lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Due Diligence\n",
    "We want to take some time to check if what we hope is true, is actually true.\n",

    "\n",
    "![technical and business due diligence](img/aiForEveryone-technical_and_business_due_diligence.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "This on the technical side, this means looking at whether the %-accuracy is feasible, the amount and quality of data is available, how long it will take to “code” and deliver and whether there’s a technical team available.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can and should also add an ethical due-diligence to evaluating our AI projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build vs Buy\n",
    "ML projects can be in-house or outsourced.\n",
    "\n",
    "DS projects tend to be more in-house as they tend to depend on intimate knowledge of the company’s data, everyday activities, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things will be industry-standard – in these cases, don’t bother building them in-house; you’re probably better off embracing the existing tool than building it yourself… unless this is something that will give you a large defensible advantage.\n",

    "### How AI teams think about data\n",
    "- A **training set** is used to train the ML algorithm, it is typically much much much larger than the **test set**\n",
    "\t- E.g. photos of mugs labeled “ok” and “defect”\n",
    "- A **test set** is used to check if the ML algorithm is performing well\n",
    "\t- The accuracy is determined based on how many of the inputs were correctly identified\n",
    "\t- Different test sets may be used for different phases of the project, for example:\n",
    "\t\t- On top of the basic test set, an AI team might ask for a “development”, “dev”, or “validation” test set (not covered in this course)\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Don’t expect 100% from your ML algorithm:\n",
    "- ML algorithms are probabilistic\n",
    "- You might have insufficient data\n",
    "- Your training set or test set might be mislabeled\n",
    "- Your datasets might have ambiguous labels (e.g. is it a crack or a stain? A hair on the lens? Out of focus?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you don’t need 100% accuracy to get actionable outputs for improving your business. Check with your AI team to see how you can improve accuracy, and to what extent you really need to do so.\n",

    "## AI Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "**Don’t:**\n",
    "- Expect AI to solve everything\n",
    "- Hire 2-3 ML engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases\n",
    "- Don’t expect AI project to work the first time\n",
    "- Expect traditional processes to apply without changes\n",
    "- Think you need superstar AI engineers before you can do anything\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do:**\n",
    "- Be realistic about what AI can and cannot do given limitations of technology, data, and engineering resources\n",
    "- Pair engineering talent with business talent in cross-function teams to find feasible and valuable projects\n",
    "- Plan for AI development to be an iterative process, with multiple attempts needed to succeed\n",

    "\n",
    "No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data, e.g. clustering) or a means towards an end (feature learning).\n",

    "- Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\t- For something such as an autonomous helicopter, it’s very difficult to use supervised learning, as input -> output data is very hard to acquire\n",
    "\t- Instead, the AI gets to fly the helicopter (in a simulation). Each time it flies well, it is “rewarded” with a large positive number. Each time it flies poorly, you “punish” it with a large negative number. The program tries to maximize the rewards\n",
    "\t\t- This encourages it to choose good flight behaviour\n",
    "\t\t- What is good depends on what it is rewarded to do (remember that the Stanford autonomous helicopter learned how to fly upside down extremely well)\n",
    "\t- Can require a huge amount of training-generated data because it’s trying out what are theoretically infinite ways to achieve a result, most of which will be terrible choices\n",
    "- GANs (Generative Adversarial Network)\n",
    "\t- A new, exciting AI technique\n",
    "\t- Very good at synthesizing new images from scratch, and soon characters for games, video, etc.\n",

Some economic forecasts seem to suggest this will be the case, though the changes will be big (e.g. 50-80M jobs displaced in AI in the USA alone by 2030).
